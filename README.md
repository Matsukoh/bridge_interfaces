# bridge_interfaces
The example packages for ros1_bridge with custom msg/srv. 
It seems that some branches in ros1_bridge have bugs for the custom mapping system now (2021/05/27). I recomment to use [this version](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/tree/07467973c329e430cd2c101729962d8ed075885f).

Please refer [tutorial for ros1_bridge](https://github.com/ros2/ros1_bridge/blob/master/doc/index.rst) to learn how to use these packages.
